    <h1>About The space</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Space, often referred to as outer space, is the vast and largely empty expanse that exists beyond Earth and its atmosphere, encompassing everything from our planet to the farthest reaches of the observable universe. It includes our solar system, which is composed of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and various smaller objects like asteroids and comets. Our solar system resides in the Milky Way, a galaxy containing billions of stars, star clusters, and interstellar gas and dust, all bound together by gravity. Beyond the Milky Way, there are billions of other galaxies, each with their own collection of stars and planetary systems, making up the observable universe, which spans about 93 billion light-years in diameter. Space is also the domain of many phenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, and quasars, as well as cosmic microwave background radiation, which provides evidence of the Big Bang that is believed to have initiated the expansion of the universe around 13.8 billion years ago. Additionally, space is characterized by its near-perfect vacuum, allowing for the study of celestial mechanics and the behavior of matter in extreme conditions. Human exploration of space has evolved significantly since the mid-20th century, leading to milestones like the Apollo moon landings, the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), and current missions to Mars. Technological advancements continue to push the boundaries of what we know about the universe, from the study of exoplanets that might harbor life to the ambitious goal of interstellar travel. Despite its vastness and the many mysteries it holds, space continues to captivate our imagination and drive scientific and exploratory endeavors.</p>
