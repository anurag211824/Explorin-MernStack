Weakly Typed Languages
Definition: In weakly typed languages, types are more flexible and can be implicitly converted, allowing operations between different types without explicit conversions.
Characteristics:
Type Coercion: Automatically converts types as needed for operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.
Less Type Safety: More prone to type-related bugs due to implicit type conversions.
Flexibility: Allows more flexible and often more concise code, but at the cost of potential run-time errors.
Examples:
Statically Typed: C, C++ (though they can be considered strongly typed depending on context and usage)
Dynamically Typed: JavaScript (in some contexts), PHP, Perl
